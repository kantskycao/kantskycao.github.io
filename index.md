## About Me

I am currently a research associate professor at Westlake Institute for Optoelectronics, specializing in the control and planning of aerial robotic systems. I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in aerospace engineering from Harbin Engineering University in 2013 and my Ph.D. in the same field from Beihang University in 2018.
From 2018 to 2019, I served as a Research Scientist at the Southwest China Research Institute of Electronic Equipment. I then worked as a Research Fellow at the School of Engineering, Westlake University from 2019 to 2024. I am passionate about developing intelligent and practical robotic systems, and I am always open to collaborations and research opportunities in robotics, autonomous systems, and related fields.
